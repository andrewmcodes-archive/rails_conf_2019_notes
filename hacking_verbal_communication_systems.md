## Notes

- Conversations are meant to be exchanged and made up of multiple ideas
- Individuals don't need to be heard, they need their ideas need to interact

### Flow control

- We have complex semi-conscious real-time algorithms which we use in collaboration with other people's complex semi-conscious real-time algorithms to control the flow of conversation
- Acknowledgment signal vs interruption system
- Our algorithms are all different
- [occupy together hand signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_movement_hand_signals#/media/File:Hands_signals-Occupy-A4.svg)

#### Race conditions

- We use pauses in our language as part of the flow control signalling, this generates race conditions
- These allow others to know they can insert a point/make bid to enter the conversation
- Using a visual channel for explicit signalling allows people to avoid some of the race conditions
- You make better decisions when all the information is present
- You only see the current speaker being stepped on, not all of the others who are waiting to talk
  - someone who wants clarifications vs to move on to another subject
- Inserting yourself into conversation is a skill that is unevenly distributed, and does not correlate to the value of what is to be said

### Consensus Modeling

- The 'speaking' set of symbols
- Subtitles for the conversational meta-track
- Different culturally
- Can be much friendlier for neurodiverse individuals

### Implementation points

- Works great with an explicit facilitator (makes their job easier)
- Can help encourage underrepresented people to contribute
- [Progressive stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_stack)
- Doesn't work audio-only / disadvantages for seeing-impaired
- Hand signals are not the only form of conversational flow systems
- [Robert's rules of order](https://robertsrules.org)

### Wrap up

- Open's up questions like: "did you need clarification or just want to move on?"
- The more you use it, the less you might need to use it, but don't let it slip into undocumented dogma
  - Don't let system become like a secret handshake
  - Don't make new people have to figure it out on their own
- Send the right signals
- Be intentional about your culture, and you will get more of it
